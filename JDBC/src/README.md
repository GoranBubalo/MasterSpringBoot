# How to add a extra row to a existing table in database 

---

#  Step
Download MySQL connector/Driver. Extract it and find the JAR file (e.g., mysql-connector-j-8.3.0.jar.
Then put that into the project folder

## Then run the command below
- javac -cp ".;../mysql-connector-j-9.3.0.jar" Main.java
- java -cp ".;../mysql-connector-j-9.3.0.jar" Main

### Example: 
- The first line builds the toy car 
- The second command line starts the engine of the toy car 

### One small problem
- When changing the value of what you want to insert into the db you need to build it again and then run it.
